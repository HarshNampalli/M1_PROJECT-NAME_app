## Introduction
Two players choose either rock (r), paper (p), or scissors (s) at the same time in the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) (s). Informally, the game's rules are "rock beats scissors, paper beats paper, and scissors beats scissors." The round is a tie if two players choose the identical item.
## Objective
The goal of Rock, Paper, Scissors is to defeat your opponent by choosing a weapon that defeats their choice according to the rules below:
Scissors is smashed (or blunted) by Rock, hence Rock wins.
Scissors cut paper, so Scissors come out on top.
Paper outperforms Rock, resulting in a Paper victory.
If both players pick the same weapon, neither wins, and the game is restarted.
